PTEN_Ptase2.pdb is the structure generated with Modeller (Fionas script for generation of both loops and helix)
The structure is truncated to contain res 1-186 (only Ptase domain)
Truncation done in PyMOL


PTEN_FL2.pdb is the structure generated with Modeller (fionas script for generation of both loops and helix)
